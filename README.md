Wing ordering robot

Wingy will post an order form to slack. Once all the orders are gathered it will then open a chrome instance via puppeteer and place all of the others. Once i have manually verified the orders
and placed the order it will calculate the payments and message all participants. It then provides status updates in the slack thread.
